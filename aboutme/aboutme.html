        <h2>Karylle</h2>
        <p>I'm 21 years old from the Philippines, currently in my 3rd year in university, studying Business Administration concentrating on Business Economics.
        I took Pathway during my 2nd year and had a lot of fun with trying out programming so here I am!</p>
        <p>During my free time, I like hiphop dancing with my crew and recently I have been enjoying crocheting.
        I'm also an avid reader (though I don't get to read as much as I would like recently), and playing mobile games. I also like
        learning languages. Currently, I'm trying to improve my Chinese :)</p>
        <p>I'm a third generation member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and I'm grateful for the Church for bringing me closer to God.
        Of course, being able to enjoy studying online through BYU-I is one of the fruits of growing up in the Church, and I'm excited to grow and learn even more.
        I hope to work with everyone soon, and I wish you all a productive semester!</p>
