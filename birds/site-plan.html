        The Parrot Ship is an online website about birds, specifically parrots and lovebirds. 
        The main audience of the site will be people who are looking for birds and avian enthusiasts
        of all ages. 
        The Home Page will feature a short background of The Parrot Ship. This will include some basic information about who started The Parrot Ship, the reasons why the aviary was created, and other fun facts. The Parrot Ship is a family-owned aviary that started in 2020. It was founded by a seafarer who wanted to share their love for birds with others. Although the aviary is not limited to only a few bird species, The Parrot Ship hopes to be able to expand and accommodate more parrots in the future.
        The page will also contain other useful information, such as contact and social media information. The Parrot Ship will only have Facebook as its social media. Interested visitors can follow the aviary's Facebook page to get updates on new arrivals, breeding news, and other interesting bird-related topics.

      <h3>Parrots</h3>
      <p>
        This page will showcase the different parrot species we have in the aviary. It will include the
        specie names of the parrots, short descriptions, and other factual and useful information. The
        first parrot that will be showcased would be the sun conure. The sun conure is a small 
        parrot species that is known for its vibrant colors and playful personality. They are social 
        birds that love to interact with their owners.
        The page will also feature medium-sized parrots, such as the Indian ringneck parrot and the blue-naped parrot.
        The Indian ringneck parrot is a medium-sized parrot species that is native to India and Southeast Asia. 
        They are known for their beautiful plumage and can live up to 25 years or more. The blue-naped parrot is another medium-sized parrot species that is native to the Philippines. 
        They are intelligent birds that can learn to perform tricks and enjoy playing with toys.
        The page can also serve as a guide for people who are looking to raise birds, but are not sure which
        bird specie to adopt or raise. The page will also contain a short description about parrots as a 
        whole.

      <h3>Lovebirds</h3>
      <p>
        This page will showcase the lovebirds we have in the aviary. Like the "Parrots" page, it will
        include the specie names of the lovebirds, short descriptions, and other information. This
        is especially useful in identifying lovebird species because there are a lot of mutations. 
        Lovebirds are small parrots that are known for their playful and affectionate personalities. 
        They are social birds that form strong bonds with their mates and can also bond with their owners.
        The page will feature lovebird species, such as the opaline lovebird and the black-masked lovebird. The page will
        also contain general information about African lovebirds.
